      This stewpot is part of the Scanpan Classic cookware range, which boasts GreenTek non-stick coating which is 100% PFOA free, meaning it's safer for your family and the environment. The heavy-duty, pressure-cast aluminum body has an extra-thick base for quick, even heating and it is compatible with all cooking surfaces (excluding induction). The extraordinarily hard exterior surface is a combination of ceramic and titanium nonstick cooking surface which is impossible to scrape away, even with metal utensils. Patented spring-lock handle stays cool during normal stove top use and the stewpot is also oven safe from up to 260°C. It's also dishwasher safe for easy cleanup.
